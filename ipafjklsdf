 Introduction[m
 Population of a species inhabit in natural habitat is a good system to understanding the consequences of what evolutionary processes in which the populations have been gone through.  The populations experienced heterogeneity microenvironments which created different selection pressures lead to evolution of local adaptation. [m
 Kawecki and Ebert (2004) explained the term "local adaptation" for patterns and processes observed across local populations of the same species connected, at least potentially, by dispersal and gene flow". [m
